# Predicting Corrosion Behavior Using Deep Learning
Remark: This repository is part of the supporting information for our publication.

Brift: Understanding corrosion behavior is crucial for enhancing steel durability and reliability. Traditional methods require extensive experimental effort over long periods. Our study addresses this by using deep learning to predict the progression of corrosion from early-stage topographical data. We quantitatively predicted the later stages of local corrosion and visualized the formation, growth, and accumulation of particle-like oxides. Our method is adaptable to other corrosion-resistant electrochemical materials.
